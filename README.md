# arroyoTeensy
Low-cost hydroacoustic datalogger with similar capability to the [Arroyo](https://github.com/bugoutput/arroyo-hydroacoustic-logger), but based on the [Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) microcontroller platform rather than the Raspberry Pi. Using Teensy results in much lower power consumption, enabling the Arroyo to continuously record audio in the field for long periods of time off of battery power without requiring a solar array.
